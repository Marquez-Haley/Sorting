# Sorting
A program that randomly generates [1,000, 10,000, and 100,000] integer values (in the range of 0 to 10^6) that are inserted into a list. 
Implemented and sorted the data using bubble sort, insertion sort, and quick sort. Test the speed of the algortithm with the data unsorted and already sorted. 
Output to an excel file the CPU time, the number of comparisons and the number of swaps from the average of 10 sorts for each alogorithm and input size.
